                                The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
                                software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
                                cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.<br><br>
                                The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
                                to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
                                our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
                                share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
                                software for all its users.<br><br>
                                When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                                price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                                have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                                them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
                                want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
                                free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>
                                Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
                                with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
                                you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
                                and/or modify the software.<br><br>
                                A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
                                improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
                                receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
                                incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
                                encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
                                software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
                                The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
                                letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
                                source code to the public.<br><br>
                                The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
                                ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
                                to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
                                provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
                                users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
                                a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
                                code of the modified version.<br><br>
                                An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
                                published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
                                a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
                                released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
                                this license.<br><br>
                                The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                                modification follow.
