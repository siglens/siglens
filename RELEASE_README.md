# SigLens Release Instructions

SigLens Release process should generate binaries and docker images for the supported architectures & platforms

SigLens docker image should support: `linux/arm64 and linux/amd64` 

SigLens executable should support: `linux/arm64, linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, and darwin/amd64`

## SigLens Release Steps

1. The version number in `develop` will have a suffix, for example: “0.1.29d”.
2. When you are ready to do a release, remove the “d” suffix in the version number `SigLensVersion` located in `pkg/config/version.go`. ***This step is critical. Failure to increment this number will lead to failure in creating a GitHub release.***
3. Update the `CSSVersion` function in the `startQueryServer` function (located in the `startup.go` file) to return the new version number. This ensures proper cache busting for CSS files.
4. Create a pull request to merge these changes into `develop`. After merging, `develop` will now have the updated version number without the "d" suffix, for example: “0.1.29”.
5. Add detailed release notes in the pull request describing the changes, enhancements, and bug fixes in this release.
6. Merge develop to `main` using Create a Merge Commit. Do NOT Squash and Merge.
7. GitHub Actions will take care of the following builds:
   1. siglens docker image
      - `linux/amd64, linux/arm64`
      - The docker image build uses buildx to create an image index & the corresponding builds
8. Once the release completes, increment the version number and CSS version number in `develop`. The version in the `develop` branch should include a suffix, for example: "0.1.30d" for differentiation.

Note: The main branch will never have the "d" suffix in the version number. The "d" suffix is only for the develop branch to indicate a development version.
