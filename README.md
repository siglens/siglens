# SigLens

SigLens is an Open Source Observability solution that is **100x** more efficient than Splunk, Elastic. 

# Why SigLens:
Our experience servicing 10,000+ engineers with Observability tools taught us a few things:

- Developers have to jump through different tools for logs, metrics, traces
- Splunk, DataDog, NewRelic are very expensive
- ElasticSearch takes too many machines, cluster maintenance is hard
- Grafana Loki has slow query performance

Armed with decades of experience in monitoring domain, we set out to build a observability DB from the ground up, uniquely suited for logs, metrics and traces with **`zero`** external dependencies. A **`single binary`** that you can run on your laptop and process `8 TB/day` on it.
