# SigLens

SigLens is an Open Source Observability solution that is **100x** more efficient than Splunk, Elastic. 

# Why SigLens:
Our experience servicing 10,000+ engineers with Observability tools taught us a few things:

- Developers have to jump through different tools for logs, metrics, traces
- Splunk, DataDog, NewRelic are very expensive
- ElasticSearch takes too many machines, cluster maintainence is hard
- Grafana Loki has slow query performance

Armed with decades of experience in monitoring domain, we set out to build a observability DB from the ground up, uniquely suited for logs, metrics and traces with **`zero`** external dependencies. A **`single binary`** that you can run on your laptop and process `8 TB/day` on it.

# Differentiators

### SigLens v/s Elasticsearch 
Check out this <a href="https://www.sigscalr.io/blog/sigscalr-vs-elasticsearch.html" target="_blank">blog</a> where SigLens is ` 8x ` Faster than Elasticsearch

### SigLens v/s ClickHouse 
Check out this <a href="https://www.sigscalr.io/blog/sigscalr-vs-clickhouse.html" target="_blank">blog</a> where SigLens is `4x-37x` Faster than ClickHouse

### SigLens v/s Splunk,Elastic,Loki  
Check out this <a href="https://www.sigscalr.io/blog/petabyte-of-observability-data.html" target="_blank">blog</a> where SigLens ingested data at 1 PB/day rate for 24 hours on a mere `32 EC2 instances` compared to `3000 EC2 instances` required for Splunk, Elastic, Grafana Loki
